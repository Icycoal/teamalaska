# InCollege - User Authentication System (COBOL)

## Overview
This is the **InCollege Project: Week 3 Deliverable - Log In, Part 1**, a console-based COBOL application that simulates a basic **user authentication system**. Users can create new accounts, log in, and navigate initial post-login options.  

The project demonstrates:
- File-based input/output handling
- Account persistence
- Password validation
- Menu-driven user interface
